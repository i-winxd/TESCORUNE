# CHANGELOG

## 1.0.1

6:43PM EST 1/5/2026

Remove all mercy changed from 6.5 to 7

This resolves any issues with the mercy meter being rounded up.

## 1.0.2

7:06PM EST 1/5/2026

- Remove all mercy now alternates between 6 and 7 (if 6 was added, 7 gets added next and vice versa). This ensures the fight remains its intended pacing.

- Fixed instant coffee giving infinite TP by selecting and deselecting it over and over again.

Sorry if this number is unfortunate but this is the compromise. Trust me, people aren't finding 69 funny anymore?

# 1.0.3

7:18PM EST 1/5/2026

- Using the funny cheat (the one that enranges spamton) will now
change the dialogue for one of the attacks.
- increased pop sound volume

# 1.0.4

1:24PM EST 1/6/2016

- Bag attack (usually the second attack in the game) will now have the enemy explain how to fire shots
- Severely nerfed Tesco's hitbox for all Tesco attacks, making a lot harder to get hit by the logo
- To cheat you now must cheat 20 times instead of 1 time since there are false positives
- The dialogue that shows on cheating will now tell you how to cheat (ironically)
