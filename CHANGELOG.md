# CHANGELOG

## 1.0.1

6:43PM EST 1/5/2026

Remove all mercy changed from 6.5 to 7

This resolves any issues with the mercy meter being rounded up.

## 1.0.2

7:06PM EST 1/5/2026

- Remove all mercy now alternates between 6 and 7 (if 6 was added, 7 gets added next and vice versa). This ensures the fight remains its intended pacing.

- Fixed instant coffee giving infinite TP by selecting and deselecting it over and over again.

Sorry if this number is unfortunate but this is the compromise. Trust me, people aren't finding 69 funny anymore?
